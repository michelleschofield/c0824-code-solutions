## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  getting the data out and putting it in variables
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  the property/variable names inside curly braces separated by commas on the left of the assignment operator, and on the right is the object getting destructured. It's like the shorthand for an object literal but but swapped left and right sides
- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  on the left is the variable name for the elements to be retrieved from the array inside square brackets and separated by commas, and on the left is the array that's getting destructured
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  when creating a literal, the brackets and values are on the right of the assignment operator, but when destructuring the brackets with the variable names are on the left of the assignment operator.
