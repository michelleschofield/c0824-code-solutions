                Canvas in meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and
                community resources. At a minimum, this means porting over you
                fax number, enrolling you payers with our clearinghouse, and
                getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load you
                preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that
                sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if
                interfaces with health information exchanges or other
                information technology vendors are important, we will word with
                you to determine what we can deliver and when.

                The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of
                your current data, which we have executed successfully with both
                remotely hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our word
                begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and
                information like medications, problems, and allergies is
                relatively straightforward. While importing clinical notes and
                documents is more challenging, our team has been able to do this
                at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.
