                Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across
                clinicians, staff, and patients themselves -- making you more
                productive, less stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into
                your practice of medicine.

            You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce
            around five windows to discover the last blood count. Canvas pulls
            everything you need directly into you note, so you never have to
            leave it. And because Canvas learns from every interaction, it gets
            smarter with every patient you see.

            &quot;Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance
            dramatically on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to use.
            The right information is presented in the right way at the right
            time, and the product leverages technology to actually improve the
            quality of care I provide.&quot;

              &quot;Which of my uncontrolled diabetic patients haven't had a
              test in the past 3 months? Which of my patients are on potentially
              unsafe levels of opioids according to the most recent guidelines?
              That doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously
              important questions. But I just couldn't get an answer from our
              old system! Canvas is light-years ahead.&quot;

            <p class="text">
              Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand
              performance, but they aren't enough to improve quality and
              increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols
              and charge capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work
              only they can do.

              &quot;With MIPS a reality fee-for-service billing rules as complex
              as ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to keep up.
              We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a
              group of coders to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has
              completely eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue
