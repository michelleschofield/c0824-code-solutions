## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  Me: No, but devs that use AI will replace those that don't (yes I stole that)
  ChatGPT: Will AI Replace Software Developers?
  AI is unlikely to fully replace software developers in the foreseeable future. While AI tools are becoming increasingly advanced and can automate some aspects of coding, such as generating code snippets or assisting with debugging, several key aspects of software development still rely heavily on human skills:

Complex Problem-Solving: Human developers are better at understanding and solving complex, context-specific problems. AI can help with pattern recognition and automation but struggles with the nuanced understanding required for complex issues.

Creativity and Innovation: Designing new features, creating innovative solutions, and addressing unique user needs often require creativity and critical thinking, areas where human developers excel.

Communication and Collaboration: Software development involves working with teams, clients, and stakeholders to understand requirements and iterate on solutions, which involves interpersonal skills AI cannot fully replicate.

Ethical Considerations: Developers make decisions involving ethics and context, such as data privacy and user impact, which require a human touch.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?
  Me: to ask for explanations of concepts and syntax, not for writing code
  ChatGPT: What Is the Best Way to Use AI Tools When Learning Software Development?
  When learning software development, AI tools can be incredibly useful if used correctly. Here are some effective ways to leverage them:

Code Assistance and Suggestions: Use AI tools to help you understand syntax and common coding patterns. For example, tools like GitHub Copilot can suggest code snippets and provide real-time assistance, helping you learn faster.

Debugging Help: AI-driven debugging tools can identify errors and suggest fixes, helping you learn debugging techniques and understand common pitfalls.

Learning Resources: AI can recommend resources and tutorials based on your progress and interests, tailoring your learning experience to your needs.

Practice and Repetition: AI tools can generate practice problems and coding challenges to help reinforce concepts and skills.

Understanding Concepts: Use AI tools to break down complex code and explain how it works, helping you grasp underlying principles.

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  Me: not learning how to do it myself and therefore not really understanding how it works
  ChatGPT: What Is the Danger of Using AI Tools for Software Development While I’m Still Learning?
  While AI tools can be valuable, there are some risks and pitfalls to be aware of:

Over-Reliance: Relying too heavily on AI tools can prevent you from developing a deep understanding of fundamental concepts. It’s important to engage with the material actively rather than just accepting AI-generated solutions.

Shallow Learning: AI tools might offer solutions without explaining the underlying principles, leading to a superficial understanding of coding practices and problem-solving techniques.

Misleading Information: AI tools are not infallible and can occasionally provide incorrect or suboptimal solutions. Relying on these tools without verifying the correctness can lead to bad habits or misconceptions.

Loss of Problem-Solving Skills: Regularly using AI to generate code or fix errors without trying to solve problems on your own might hinder your ability to develop critical problem-solving skills.

Lack of Contextual Understanding: AI tools may not always provide context-specific solutions, which means you might miss out on learning how to apply concepts in different scenarios.

To mitigate these dangers, use AI tools as a supplementary aid rather than a crutch. Make sure to actively engage with the learning process, understand the reasoning behind code and fixes, and develop your problem-solving skills alongside using these tools.

My observations are that the AI answered much more in depth and are way to long to read
